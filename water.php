            <p>In a world where access to clean water remains a pressing concern, Bangladesh emerges as a focal point, grappling with both the challenges of rapid urbanization and the consequences of climate change.
            </p>
            <p> Bangladesh, with its dense population and low-lying topography, is exceptionally vulnerable to water-related challenges. Frequent flooding, arsenic contamination, and unequal distribution underscore the urgency of addressing water justice. The disparities in access to clean water disproportionately affect marginalized communities, exacerbating socio-economic inequities.</p>
